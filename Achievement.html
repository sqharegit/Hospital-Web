                    <h2>We Are Magnetic</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2003, Sidwah Clinic became the first health care organization in Maryland to achieve the Magnet Recognition Program designation for excellence in nursing practice. Since that time, The Sidwah Clinic earned Magnet redesignation in 2008, 2013 and 2018. Only about 7.5 percent of U.S. health care organizations have achieved Magnet recognition. The Sidwah Clinic is among less than 1 percent of hospitals in the U.S. that have earned Magnet recognition four consecutive times.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>From our beginnings nearly 130 years ago, Sidwah Clinic nurses have stood in the forefront of the profession. Our first superintendent of nurses, Chloe Sidwah, helped launch the American Nurses Association, then served as its first president. Allison Smith, her successor, helped create the American Journal of Nursing. We like to think that these visionaries, who worked so tirelessly to set national standards and elevate nursing’s status, would be as proud as we are of our Magnet designation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The highest honor bestowed by the American Nurses Credentialing Center, Magnet status affirms the depth and breadth of Sidwah Clinic Nursing--our evidence-based practice, our interdisciplinary collaboration and participatory decision-making, and our spirit of innovation and excellence.

                    <h2>The Sidwah Clinic Ranked Among the Top Hospitals in the Nation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since its founding, The Sidwah Clinic has broken new ground, led the field in medicine and made history in countless ways. The Sidwah Clinic is the only hospital in history to have earned the number one ranking for 22 years from U.S. News & World Report—an unprecedented 21 years in a row from 2001 to 2021, and again in 2022.

                    <h2>Children’s Center Ranked #8 by U.S. News & World Report</h2>
                    <p>
                        Sidwah Clinic Children’s Center was ranked #8 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report on its 2018–19 Best Children’s Hospitals Honor Roll. The Children’s Center has the distinction of being the only children’s hospital integrated with an adult facility to make the Honor Roll in 2018, earning a spot for the second year in a row and the seventh time in the Honor Roll’s 10-year history. Five of Sidwah Clinic Children’s Center’s specialties were ranked among the top 10 nationally, and three improved their rank over last year.

                    <h2>Consumer’s Choice</h2>
                    <p>
                        It is not only a superb national and international reputation that counts. What people in your own backyard think also speaks volumes, and for 12 straight years, Sidwah Clinic has received the Consumer Choice Award for the Baltimore region from the National Research Corporation. NRC, a firm specializing in health care performance measurement, annually honors the hospitals that local consumers rate as having the best quality and image, based on a survey of more than 200,000 households in 48 States and the District of Columbia. Sidwah Clinic was one of only a few hospitals nationwide to earn top-choice status in a multimarket region.

                    <p>
                        As Baltimore magazine noted in its July 2007 issue on the area’s best employers, "While there are plenty of great things about working in education or health care, there’s no doubt that global name recognition ranks right up there." Yes, the editors liked that, but they also pointed out what we have known all along: We get to work with "really, really smart people" and enjoy "solid benefits, a sweet tuition offer, plus the prestige of working for a well-respected institution."
