            <h1>Services</h1>
            <p>Hospital services Sidwah Clinic offers include anything and everything that hospitals offer to their recipients. Most of these depend on the department, customer requirements and expectations.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="visit-col">
                    <h3>Out patient Department (OPD)</h3>
                    <p>Every hospital needs to have an OPD (Outpatient Department) as one of the core services rendered so Sidwah Clinic Provides you with the best. A set of skilled doctors along with technicians are available, who can assist patients in preliminary diagnosis and related treatments.</p>
                    <p>Doctors prescribe medicines or diagnostic tests to evaluate patient’s health condition. They are also required to be available for follow up visits to monitor conditions and treatment procedures. Depending on the response, patients are either asked for admission or specialized services such as surgeries.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="visit-col">
                    <h3>Nursing</h3>
                    <p>Nurses employed by Sidwah Clinic function as connecting bridges between doctors and the patients they treat. Nurses at Sidwah Clinic look after the overall well being of patients. They ensure that all health related instructions given by doctors are implemented and followed by patients.</p>
                    <p>Nurses are employed in different departments within Sidwah Clinic. Sidwah Clinic hire trained nurses who are technically sound to perform advanced tasks relevant to diagnosis, treatment and care of sick ones.</p>
                    <p>Sidwah Clinic therefore has a separate nursing department which forms a core segment of hospitalisation.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="visit-col">
                    <h3>Pharmacy and Diagnosis</h3>
                    <p>Most Sidwah Clinic branches around the world do maintain a pharmacy and diagnostic department of their own. This is a very important segment as easy and quick availability of medicines and other equipment required for treatment procedure is vital to render best healing services.</p>
                    <p>However, many a times, Sidwah Clinic do not guarantee the availability of all medicines that are being prescribed and therefore independent pharmacies are equally important. Further, 9 out of 10 Sidwah Clinics maintain a separate laboratory and diagnostic section where related tests can be carried out. Again, similar to pharmacies, these diagnostic departments do not offer wide variety of test and analysis for patients.</p>

                    <h3>Ward Facilities</h3>
                    <p>One of the distinguishing factors that marks Sidwah Clinic unique, with respect to other health facilities; such as, clinics and care centers is that they provide both inpatient and outpatient care provisions.</p>
                    <p>Every hospital needs to have ward allotment for patients suffering from severe illness and injuries. This enables care givers to monitor health conditions continuously and thereby, accurate treatment procedures can be opted for.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="visit-col">
                    <h3>Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department</h3>

This department will be under the direction of a well – qualified physician who has special training in the field of physical medicine and rehabilitation. His staff should include therapists with qualification in the various specialties.</p>

                            <p>Patients with kidney disease often need regular treatments of dialysis. Dialysis is a process that filters and cleans the blood artificially—the work functioning kidneys normally take on.</p>

                                <p>The medical office runs on communications, and they must be clear and complete as they will impact the health of the patients.</p>

                                <p>Hospice can be a particularly confusing title. It represents a package of insurance benefits that deals with an end-of-life trajectory. It also represents a philosophy of care provision for dying patients as well as official networks that offer hospice care. Hospice is also a designation for specific healthcare facilities that specialize in end-of-life care.</p>

                        <p>The anesthesiologist also plays a key role in critical care and treatment and trauma. They assess patients, make diagnoses, provide support for breathing and circulation, and help to ensure that infection is prevented.</p>
